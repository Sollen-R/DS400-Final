# DS400-Final

This project is to satisfy the requirements of DS400 and the Data Science B.S. program.

I plan to do data analysis and prediction on the "Chicago Traffic Crashes" dataset, sourced from Kaggle.
See link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anoopjohny/traffic-crashes-crashes

Plans include prediction of crash likelihood based on conditions and location, as well as a map of the city with heatmapping of areas where crashes are more likely,
and options for different weather conditions and times of day.
